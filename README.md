1. I would not use a unit test to test the message feature since the message feature is the entire point of the app, therefore it's too big of a scale for a unit test. It has multiple components working together so unit tests which want to test functions in isolation isn't a good fit.
2. You would since that's a small part of the messaging feature and so it's a small scale and we can test it easily. And since it's only 80 characters its even better since it's small and can be tested easily.
